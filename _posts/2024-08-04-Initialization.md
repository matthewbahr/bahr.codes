I've come to a point in my life where I think I'm making things that are interesting enough to post about. I'll be making a concerted effort to write about the latest goings-on and thoughts. 

I expect this to lean much more into the maker/3d printing aspects of what I do since Kotlin/Android is my day to day and usually my side projects are escapist.
